## Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) for exploration in cluttered environments

Assuming you have followed the installation instructions in the top-level project ```README.md```, to run this code, simply execute the ```main.py``` script either from your IDE or from the command line.

Figures used in the project can be found in the ```fig``` folder, and videos used in the project video can be found in the ```vid``` folder.

**NOTE**: By default the visualisation of RRT examples is commented out in ```main.py``` (it produces a lot of plots!). To turn this on, simply uncomment the last few lines of ```main.py```.
